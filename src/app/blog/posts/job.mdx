Lately, I made the difficult decision to step away from finishing my Industrial Engineering degree due to complicated circumstances. 
Now, I’m facing a dilemma: should I apply to data and tech-related roles now, or continue my studies by transferring to a school that offers a 2-year IT course?

One thing that surprised me during this journey: how often job listings labeled “entry-level” still demand 3+ years of experience, a four-year degree, and full availability—all for an onsite role with little training or flexibility.

In one of my early interviews, I was hit with a full-on machine learning theory assessment… for a job that mainly involved monitoring an AI trading bot during graveyard shifts.

Another interviewer responded to a simple question—“What challenges does this role face?”—with an evasive, defensive reply. 
In other cases, I was politely reminded I don’t have a degree yet, as if the hands-on projects and continuous self-learning I’ve done didn’t count.

But interviews should be a two-way street.

Asking questions isn’t arrogance—it’s due diligence. It’s our right to know whether a company deserves our time and effort, just as much as they’re deciding if we deserve theirs.

I may not have a diploma (yet), but I have grit, curiosity, and a serious hunger to learn and grow. 
I know there are companies out there that value potential, not just checkboxes.
